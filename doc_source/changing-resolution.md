# Changing display resolution<a name="changing-resolution"></a>

By default, NICE DCV automatically adapts the display resolution of the remote machine to match the current size of the client\. When the client window is resized, DCV requests the server to change its display resolution to a size that fits within the client window\.

If you prefer a fixed resolution on the server, which does not change even when the client window is resized, select the **Display Resolution** menu and specify the desired resolution\. If you decide to re\-enable automatic resize, you can select **Adapt automatically **\.

This functionality is available on the Windows client, web browser client, Linux client, and macOS client\.
