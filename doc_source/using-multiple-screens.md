# Using Multiple Screens<a name="using-multiple-screens"></a>

NICE DCV enables you to extend the session's display across multiple screens\.

**Note**  
Multiple\-screens are only supported with the Windows, Linux, and web browser client\. It is not supported with the macOS client\.

With the Windows, and Linux clients, the extended display matches your physical display layout and screen resolutions\. For example, if you have three screens connected to your local computer, the server extends the session's display across three screens and matches your screen resolutions\.

With the web browser client, the session display can be extended to up to two screens with 1920x1080 screen resolution\. When the display is extended, the additional screen is opened in a new browser window\. The second extends the display to the right of the original screen\. Ensure that you position the screens accordingly\.

**Note**  
If the requested layout is not supported by the server, the layout might be adjusted to match the server's display limitations\. If the layout can't be adjusted to match the server's display limitations, the request fails and the changes are not applied\.

**To extend the displays using the Window, and Linux clients**
+ In the client, choose **Enter fullscreen**, **Across all monitors**\.
