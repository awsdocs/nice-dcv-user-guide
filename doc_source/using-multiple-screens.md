# Using multiple monitors<a name="using-multiple-screens"></a>

DCV is capable of extending full screen resolution across a single monitor, a set of selected monitors, or all available monitors\.

You can also manually specify custom display layouts\. For more information, see [ Managing the NICE DCV Session Display Layout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/managing-session-display.html) in the *NICE DCV Administrator Guide*\.

**Note**  
If the requested layout is not supported by the server, the layout might be adjusted to match the display limits of your server\. If the layout cannot be adjusted, the request fails and the changes are not applied\.
