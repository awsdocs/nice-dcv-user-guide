# Connecting to a NICE DCV session<a name="using-connecting"></a>

After the NICE DCV session starts running on the NICE DCV server, you can connect to it using your preferred client\. Ensure that you have the required information when connecting to your NICE DCV session\. For more information, see [Step 1: Get the NICE DCV Session Information](getting-started.md#getting-started-session)\.

If you're connecting to a console session, contact your NICE DCV server administrator\. With them, ensure that the session is started and confirm the server and session details\. If you're connecting to a virtual session on a Linux NICE DCV server, you might need to start your own session\. For more information, see [Starting NICE DCV Sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/managing-sessions-start.html) in the *NICE DCV Administrator Guide*\.
