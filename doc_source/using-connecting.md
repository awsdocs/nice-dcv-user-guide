# Connecting to a NICE DCV Session<a name="using-connecting"></a>

After the NICE DCV session is running on the NICE DCV server, you can connect to it using your preferred client\. Ensure that you have the required information when connecting to your NICE DCV session\. For more information, see [Step 1: Get the NICE DCV Session Information](getting-started.md#getting-started-session)\.

If you are connecting to a console session, contact your NICE DCV server administrator to ensure that the session has been started and to confirm the server and session details\. If you are connecting to a virtual session on a Linux NICE DCV server, you might need to start your own session\. For more information, see [Starting NICE DCV Sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/managing-sessions-start.html) in the *NICE DCV Administrator Guide*\.
