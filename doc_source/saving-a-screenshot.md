# Saving a screenshot<a name="saving-a-screenshot"></a>

You can use NICE DCV to save a screenshot of the NICE DCV session\. This functionality is available on the Windows, web browser, Linux, and macOS clients\. The steps for saving a screenshot are similar on all clients\.

You must be authorized to use this feature\. If you aren't authorized, the functionality isn't available in the client\. For more information, see [ Configuring NICE DCV Authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/../adminguide/security-authentication.html) in the *NICE DCV Administrator Guide*\. If you aren't authorized to save screenshots, the client also avoids the external tools that are running on your client computer to capture a screenshot of the NICE DCV client\. Images that are obtained by these tools either show a black rectangle instead of the NICE DCV client window or only show the background desktop\. This functionality is available only on Windows and macOS clients\.

**To save a screenshot**

1. Launch the client, and connect to the NICE DCV session\.

1. In the client, choose **Session**, **Save a Screenshot**\.
