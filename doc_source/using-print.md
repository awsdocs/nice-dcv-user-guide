# Printing<a name="using-print"></a>

NICE DCV enables you to print content from the NICE DCV session\. The content is exported to a printable file by a virtual NICE DCV printer\. The type of printable file created by the virtual printer depends on the client that you're using\.
+ If you are using the Windows, Linux, or macOS client, the virtual printer creates a `.PDF` file\.
+ If you are using the web browser client with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari, the virtual printer creates a `.PDF` file\.
+ If you are using the web browser client with Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, the virtual printer creates an `.XPF` file\.

After the file has been created by the virtual printer, you can download it to your local computer using the client\.

You must be authorized to use this feature\. If you are not authorized, the functionality is not available in the client\.

Printing is only supported with sessions hosted on a Windows NICE DCV server\.
