# Extending full\-screen across selected monitors<a name="full-screen-selected-monitors"></a>

If there are three or more monitors connected, DCV can also extend full\-screen across a selection of those available monitors\. If your selected monitors cannot go full screen, an error message will appear and you will need to perform the procedure again\.

Selected monitors must be set adjacent, or sharing a side with each other, in your display setting\.

*Examples of adjacent monitor placement\.*

**Note**  
The blue boxes are DCV enabled monitors\.  
The gray boxes are other monitors\.
