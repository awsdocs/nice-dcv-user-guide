# Set certificate validation policy<a name="set-certificate-validation-policy"></a>

NICE DCV uses a secure TLS connection for communication between the server and client\. The certificate validation policy determines how the NICE DCV client responds when a certificate can't be verified as trustworthy\. Set one of the following options in the connection file: 
+ `Strict`: Prohibits the connection if there is any problem validating the TLS certificate\.
+ `Ask user`: Prompts the user to determine whether to trust the certificate when a certificate can't be verified\.
+ `Accept untrusted`: Connects to the server even if the TLS certificate is self signed and can't be validated by the client\.

For information about editing the connection file, see [Using a connection file](using-connection-file.md)\.
